5 Starting ships begin right on the board, lined up in top left corner.

at start of game, before starting, user can move ships into other positions,
decide how users can move ships.  dragula for drag-and-drop?

ships can only be successfully moved if:
  - ships are entirely on the board
  - ships do not overlap

if moved, ships' start and end coordinates are updated, and coordinate of each spot is updated.

when player has decided they are finished moving their  ships, they click a ready_button that toggles a ready_state = false to  ready_state = true.
The ready_button is visibility: hidden, and pointer-event: none;.

when player ready state = true, the game starts.


player/PC take turns firing 1 shot with  X & Y  coordinates. based on click.

player cannot click on same place twice.
each button on the grid will have a state of clicked?  that is only clickable once.
Remove event listener once clicked on.

Each button has following color states:

top board (your target map):

- plain state
- successful hit state
- missed fire state

bottom board (your ships):

- plain state
- your ship state
- successful hit state
- enemy missed fire state

Color changes on click from plain to which ever proper state which is verified.


Player and PC both have a starting variable of num_sunken_ships = 0;
after every hit, a ship checks if it is sunk (none?(spot.hit = false?)).
Whenever a ship is sunk,  num_sunken_ships++;

if (num_sunken_ships >= 5) {
  the other player wins.
}


new game resets:
-ready_state = false;
-ready_button returned to visibility: visibile;.
-re-creates the starting 5 ships at their original locations with all hit states back to false
